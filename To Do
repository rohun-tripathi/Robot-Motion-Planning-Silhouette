Todo:

1. generate a case where Djikstraâ€™s algorithm traces the path from the start to the goal.


----



1. implementation of the new model for the 4D case and its representation and projection onto the 3D case - add the pretty cases when the recursion begins

2. Intersecting obstacle - try this scenario - one obstacle on top of another ones critical point. - Test thoroughly. Especially after the start and end is figured

4. fix the projection shit code for 2D - fails as soon as an angular 3D ellipse is provided

5. allow multiple CPs between slices

mention that the first prob solution is the "Equation of "Criticality""
