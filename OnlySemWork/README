This is the code the for stage1 of the project. They were finished mostly by Dec-14 and Documented and uploaded in May-15

Start with main.py

Read this README to gain an idea about the functiosn of different files : 


1. auxilary.py : this contains auxilary functios used by the other python files
2. auxilary_backup is just a copy of the above file. Last checked it was the same file on 27th Feb 4:32

3. trial.py 


##############################
INPUT FILE FORMAT
The input files are named as such. The general formulation is:
First line : the first integer is the number of obstacles and the second integer is the number of dimensions
#################

##Inout Explained
# This is a global variable that dictates tha state of the slice wrt to different ellipses

# State 1 : means the slice is intersecting and had intersected in the last slice.
# State 2 : means the slice has just started intersecting
# State 3 : means the slice has just stopped intersecting
# State 0 : means the slice is NOT intersecting and had NOT interseted in the last slice 

The complement.py has this function of name "f" but all it does is return 1 and the system is working at this stage. So don't worry about it.
